iCal feed for PagerDuty schedules

Requirements
------------
- Python >= 2.6 & < 3.0
- bottle (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/bottle)

Usage
-----
cp example_config.py config.py
Edit config.py and fill in your username/password/whatever
Run python server.py, I recommend running it under supervisord or the watchdog
daemon of your choice.

Subscribe to http://localhost:9993/calendar/operations.ics in iCal or whatever
calendar client you prefer. "operations" in this URL corresponds to the key in
the SCHEDULES dict in config.py. You may have as many schedules as you like.
